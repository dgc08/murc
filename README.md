# murc - C Compiler for Murbin and Bonsai Assembly based on chibicc

Compiler for [Murbin](https://github.com/dgc08/murmel-plusplus)

This is still under development - Check out the [chibicc](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc), by Rui Ueyama, the original x86_64 Compiler this is based on. I am using chibicc as frontent and am just rewriting the codegen.
